GENERAL OVERVIEW
----------------

This is a mobile-responsive CSS grid framework that covers columns from 1/2 all the way to 1/10. 

Images are included to show what the grid will look like on desktop and mobile.

The columns are all enclosed in a 'jumbotron' div.

Heights are not set, since the divs are floated then they must be given content or a fixed height to show.
